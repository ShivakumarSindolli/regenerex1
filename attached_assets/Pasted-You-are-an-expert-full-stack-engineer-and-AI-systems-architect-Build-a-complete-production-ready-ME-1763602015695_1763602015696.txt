You are an expert full-stack engineer and AI systems architect.
Build a complete production-ready MERN stack project called “RegeneraX — The Intelligence of Living Cities.”

The system must behave like a living digital twin of a city: understand energy, water, materials, climate conditions; run lightweight simulations; and generate regenerative architectural design proposals using pretrained AI models or LLM APIs.

📌 TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS

MongoDB with GeoJSON + geospatial indexes

Express.js + Node.js backend

React (Vite) frontend

Tailwind CSS + shadcn UI

react-leaflet for maps

Turf.js for spatial calculations

Any LLM API (OpenAI/HF) for assistant + proposals

Time-series forecasting (simple exponential smoothing function)

📌 DELIVERABLES (GENERATE THE FULL CODE)

Your output must include:

Complete folder structure for MERN

Backend code with:

/api/upload → upload GeoJSON/CSV and store in MongoDB

/api/cities/:id/layers → return building/landuse GeoJSON

/api/simulate → compute energy/water/material flows

/api/propose → generate regenerative design proposals

/api/chat → LLM-powered city intelligence assistant

/api/auth with JWT login/signup

Database models:

City, Layer, Sensor, Simulation, Proposal, User

Use GeoJSON fields + geospatial index

Simulation engine (simple version):

area × usageIntensity × climateFactor = demand

run for each building polygon

return energy + water + stress metrics

Proposal generator:
For each building produce:

Green Roof (expected energy reduction %)

Rainwater Harvesting (water savings %)

Passive Cooling Facade (temperature drop estimate)

Include deterministic numeric calculations

Produce an SVG/HTML mockup preview

Conversational AI assistant:

System prompt: “You are RegeneraX, the city’s regenerative intelligence.”

LLM must NOT invent numbers — use backend metrics provided

Frontend with:

Map page (react-leaflet)

Dashboard page with charts

Chat/Assistant UI

Data upload UI

Feature sidebar with “Simulate” + “Generate Proposal” buttons

Docker Compose for backend + MongoDB

README with:

install steps

run commands

architecture overview

📌 FUNCTIONALITY (WHAT THE APP MUST DO)

Load a city map with buildings from GeoJSON

Click a building → show properties

Run simulation → return numeric metrics

Generate regenerative proposals → return interventions + ROI estimate

Chat with AI → ask questions about city stress, flows, design decisions

Upload new city layers or sensor data

View analytics dashboard

📌 SAMPLE INPUT DATA TO USE

Sample city: Bengaluru

Include sample building footprints GeoJSON

Include sample sensor CSV (energy, water readings)

📌 DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

Produce:

complete code for backend (Express)

complete code for frontend (React Vite)

geoJSON examples

UI components in shadcn

Tailwind styling

simulation logic

proposal engine

AI chat wrapper

📌 IMPORTANT RULES

LLM should NEVER make up numbers — backend returns all numeric metrics

Code must be runnable directly after npm install and docker compose up

Keep everything minimal, clean, functional, and hackathon-ready

Now generate the entire project codebase exactly according to this specification.
